### About
---
This is my personal Laravel + Vue 3 + TailwindCSS boilerplate. 

I've done minor changes to form radio and checkbox to allow customizing colors.
The main theme colors are divided into four &mdash; primary, secondary, success, and danger.
These can be changed inside tailwind config.

More components will be added as I create more projects.
